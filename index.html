          This is intended to be a guide to complete the Arcade Game Project independently. If you experience
          difficulties along the way, I’d be interested in hearing what questions you had, not addressed here, that
          were critical in your building the Arcade Game to specifications.

          This guide targets everyone that wants to build the project independently without looking at someone else’s
          code. While we can all agree that looking at others code is useful to learning how to code, we eventually
          want to get to a point where we can take a wire frame and site map and turn it into a fully functional app
          with nothing but our skills and determination to make it happen. This is designed to assist you in that
          journey.

        If you’re like most of the students who have arrived at this project before you, you’ve probably read and
        perhaps even re-read the instructions and project rubric, downloaded the starter files, found that opening
        the index.html file only yields a blank screen, and are now wandering where the heck to start. You're
        definitely not alone in that reaction. If you are feeling frustrated or saddened that this project is giving
        you trouble, that tells me you really want to learn the material and really want to complete this project. This
        guide was created to assist your efforts.

    <section class="goal">
      <h2 class="section-headers">What is the goal?</h2>
      <div class="goal-container">

          <p>
            The Arcade Game will have a game play area, a “Player” or “Hero” character, and at least 3 Enemy
            characters
            and should be built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices. A win occurs when the Player
            navigates across the road around the moving Enemies and
            reaches
            the
            water. When the Player reaches the water,
            a modal appears congratulating the user. If the user fails to navigate the Player pass the enemies and
            collides with an Enemy, the Player’s position is reset to the start position.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Player character moves within the bounds of the game play area using the arrow keys. And when the
            Player
            reaches the water at the top of the game play area, a modal appears, and the player position resets.
          </p>

          <p>
            The modal should display over the game play area displaying a congratulations message and a button that
            closes the modal when pressed.
          </p>

          <p>
            There will be at least 3 enemies. Each Enemy moves across the road from left to right at varying speeds.
            When the
            Enemy
            reaches the end
            of the road, it reappears from the left again.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the event that the Player collides with an Enemy, the Player is reset to the starting position.

      <p>
        Here we formulate the plan by developing the program and its directions. It is a good practice to break down
        the goal into smaller goals. There are many strategies used to assist efforts—below are some of my favorites.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Google any question you might have. Google anything you don’t know. Read the answers on Stack Overflow. If
          your results do not contain what you were looking for, reword the search. Add keywords that would help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't copy and paste code. Write it out.
        </li>
        <li>Practice often.</li>
        <li>
          Build and test functionality of components in isolation if possible. Use <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>
          or a JS Playground like the one found at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://jscomplete.com">JSComplete.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Break problems down into parts.
        </li>
      </ol>
